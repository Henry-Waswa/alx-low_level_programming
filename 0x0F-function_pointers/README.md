# 0x0F. C - Function pointers

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What are function pointers and how to use them
* What does a function pointer exactly hold
* Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

---

### [0. What's my name](./0-print_name.c)
* Write a function that prints a name.

### [1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done](./1-array_iterator.c)
* Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

### [2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities](./2-int_index.c)
* Write a function that searches for an integer.

### [3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at](./3-main.c)
* Write a program that performs simple operations.
* Files 3-main.c, 3-op_functions.c, 3-get_op_func.c, 3-calc.h are part of a program that performs simple operations.

### [4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker](./100-main_opcodes.c)
