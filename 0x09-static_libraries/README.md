### [0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life](./holberton.h)
* Create the static library libholberton.a containing all the functions listed

### [1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future	](./create_static_lib.sh)
* Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
